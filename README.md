# Introduction
This is repository contains the code for the interface of my smart mirror project. I started this project because i was bored and needed a mirror. And since i am a developer i couldn't help myself and wanted to make it smart.

The code for this interface is made in 2 days and will be updated or changed when new features or ideas come to mind.

The Goal was to create a smart mirror interface that would retrieve data from my personal servers endpoints and display this information in a way that would be easy to read and look at in the early morning when i look in the mirror.

[Pictures of the smart mirror will follow in the future when it has been assembled.]

The languages used for this interface are as follows: HTML, CSS and Javascript.





## Features

- A black and white interface for a easy to read experience
- Live data retrieval from your own specified endpoints
- The ability to switch between Dutch and English languages for the interface
- The ability to display weather data
- The ability to display calender points
- The ability to display messages in the notes section


## Installation

The interface can be installed on any computer since it is just a webpage that acts as an interface for data from your own endpoints.

An example would be to install this on a Raspberry PI Zero W and opening this page in kiosk mode when the PI boots up.
